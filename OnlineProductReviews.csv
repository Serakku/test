1,"I read through the reviews on here before looking in to buying one of the couples lubricants, and was ultimately disappointed that it didn't even live up to the reviews I had read. For starters, neither my boyfriend nor I could notice any sort of enhanced or 'captivating' sensation. What we did notice, however, was the messy consistency that was reminiscent of a more liquid-y vaseline. It was difficult to clean up, and was not a pleasant, especially since it lacked the 'captivating' sensation we had both been expecting. I'm disappointed that I paid as much as I did for a lube that I won't use again, when I could just use their normal personal lubricant for 1) less money and 2) less mess.",Disappointed
1,My husband bought this gel for us. The gel caused irritation and it felt like it was burning my skin. I wouldn't recommend this gel.,Irritation
1,My boyfriend and I bought this to spice things up in the bedroom and we were both highly disappointed in this product. We bought this one because we absolutely love the ky yours and mine and we thought this would have a similar affect but it did absolutely nothing. Do not buy.,Not worth it
1,Bought this earlier today and was excited to check it out. Based on the product description I was expecting something but it was just like the regular KY. We are fans of the his and hers so we just expected more and were left a little disappointed.,Disappointing
1,I bought this product for my husband and I to try and we were not impressed at all. There was no tingling or warming. It left us both very sticky. I have used KY products in the past (loved KY his and hers) but this one was disappointing.,Not happy at all
1,My husband and I bought this for some extra fun. We werevboth extremely disappointed. Especially for the price! Do not waste your money on this product. We felt nothing but a sticky mess from it.,Very disappointing
1,Got as a surprise for my husband there is nothing special about it just a lube save the money and get plain KY if you just need a lube wish I could return it for a refund,Don't buy
1,tried it with my husband and felt no different there was no effect no change first te using ky gel not sure if i want to try any others...,pretty dissapoitned
1,Purchased this thinking it would have some sort of warming effect but it's the same as the original. Don't waste your money.,Waste of Money
1,"Bought this to enhance our time a bit, did abslutely nothing very disappointed especially because its almost 20!",waste of money
1,I bought this after really liking the his n hers variety but this is nothing like that very disappointed with this product.,Not happy with this product
1,First time purchase of this type of product. Maybe I expected too much. Did not think there was any warming feeling at all. Left us sticky! Even after trying to was it off.,Disappointed
1,I bought this and tried this with my wife but we did not enjoy it ..we did not feel anything enhancement with this product at all such as the his-her product.,Not what I expected
1,I bought this product to spice things up with my fianc and it didn't do anything! No passion. Will not buy again,Was so disappointed!!
1,"I bought this to try to spice things up, but I felt nothing. Very disappointing to be honest.",very disappointed!
3,"I bought this because it had better reviews than the his and hers jelly, but I feel like it didn't work that well for us. It was kind of warm-feeling, but that's about it. I guess I don't know what's supposed to happen! Lol",Pretty nice
3,It was my first time using k-y. It didn't do anything in my opinion it felt like every time we did anything. Then again was my first time so probably did Somthing wrong.,First time using
4,"I noticed this product on clearance at a store I shop frequently and decided to give it a try. My husband and I LOVE it! We went back and bought every box left! I, like others have mentioned, am not sure what it is supposed to do other than be a lubricant but for that purpose we like it much better than regular KY Jelly (which tends to dry out and disappear for us). This product stays on for awhile and makes for a very pleasurable experience. The only drawback is that we find it to be a bit sticky. After applying it with your hands you're left with a sticky hand and I agree a little goes a long way! I personally have to be very careful with all products due to skin irritation and surprisingly this actually seems to help that. I did NOT receive a sample and never have.",We love it!
4,I used this product a couple of times since i recived it free to try and it has been a good experiance it feel warm so its a pretty good sensation so i recomend.,good times
4,"Used a few times stays a bit sticky but not too bad, better than most products",Does the job
5,Loved This review was collected as part of a promotion.,Loved
5,This is a good product. Will give you a great feeling.,Great sensation
5,"I really enjoyed using this product with my husband. After 20+ years of marriage, things can tend to get a little tired and boring. This was just the thing we needed to shake things up a bit. The packaging and pump dispenser is awesome. The product itself does not disappoint. A little goes a very long way. It provides a slight warming sensation when in use and does not become sticky or tacky in anyway. This is an excellent choice for an intimate lubricant. I received a free product for the purpose of my review. Opinions are 100 my own.",That little extra something..
5,Awesome Product for couples. It is a warm feeling lubricant and not sticky like a lot of other lubricants.It is very easy to clean up after use.I will absolutely be purchasing more in the future. I received this product free for the purpose to give my review..Opinions are 100 my own!,Great Product!
5,"Exceptional product, this is smooth, not slimy and the warming sensation is an experience that both partners should share at least once in their lifetime. Great way to shake things up!",Why wouldn't you try it
5,I used this for the first time with my boyfriend and he loved it just as much as I did. Didn't get sticky and felt great the entire time.,Amazing!
5,Great product! Exactly what it says works very well,Amazing
5,"yes, the scent is the best. if you like lemon frosting you won't be able to get enough of this lotion. but also, it's almost 100 natural, none of the yucky ingredients like in major brands of lotion. no mineral oil, no petroleum, etc. but also, it completely works. you know how sometimes you opt for organic choices and it's good, but not as good as popular but nastier brands jr watkins delivers. this lotion softens your hands and body, leaves you ungreasy and smells perfect. even my fiance likes it and uses it and he's pretty much anti-lotion in all regards. the price is absolutely right, too--get it!",Yummilicious And...
5,"The Hand-Cream-Lemon-Cream has such a refreshing fragrance. I wish it would last all day. It is soothing to the hands and I get compliments when I use it especially from my daughters and granddaughters, they want me to get some for them It is one of my favorite hand creams. I wish Watkins still had the vanilla body cream that too was a favorite.",One of my favorites
5,Smells like a lemon cookie. Absolutely love!!! My kids love it.,Hand cream
5,You will LOVE this lotion. I smile every time I put it on.,If you like lemon frosting
5,This hand cream is so nice that I had it on my desk at work and someone stole it after just two days! Broke my heart a little,Someone stole it!
5,"I love this lotion. Nice and thick, great fragrance. I use it on my hands and my feet.",Thick and works!
4,Not sure how this works with clearing your complexion (been using for 2 weeks now) but does keep your skin smooth and clean.,Ok so far
5,Makes my skin feel clean and not super dry where its ashy if i dont follow with a moisturiser as soon as im done. The skin doesnt feel oily or tacky. Makes my skin more radiant and use of foundation and concealer is not needed to make the skin look even and hydrated.,Still Works
5,It makes my face feel nice and fresh. After about 3 days i did get slight acne but it cleared right back up! Will deff use this every day from now on!,Ambi Skincare
5,"I have used this soap for years and considered it Wal-Mart's best kept secret. I was so disappointed when they stopped carrying it in our store location. Was delighted to see I could get it online it ended up a blessing. I don't go to Wal-Mart as often so I'm saving money there (Sorry Walmart), delivery was prompt, I stockpiled and never left the house.",Ambi soap
1,I WON'T recommend this product to anyone,It has a nasty smell that would get anyone sick
1,My 8 month old baby got extremely irritated from this product after using for less than a week. I would like to get my money back.,Very bad reaction
2,"I did receive 1 bottle but when I ordered, it said a pack of 6. I was disappointed about that. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",Not the quantity specifed
3,"You would think it's convenient to have bubble bath and wash in the same container, but it just means you buy twice the amount... My son loves the bubbles though so no complaints.",It's bubble bath.
4,"Well, Johnson's need I say more I know, right. Ok, but I will. I have used Johnson's since I was a baby, yes it's been a long time. But let's get to the Chase, it's 2 in 1. Come on, who doesn't like 2 in 1 It's hard enough to get the little loves clean, so any help is always a blessing... So, Johnson's Bubble Bath and wash is a must have in this house!!!",2 In 1!!!

4,Amazing product. My 3 years old loves her bubble baths.,Love it. Whats not to love!!
5,I absolutely love this bubblebath. It smells so good and it body wash too. My little one has very sensitive skin so this is a great option for her to still enjoy bubbles and not break out.,Love this stuff!
5,I bought a small sample size of this a couple months back and loved it. The smell is just wonderful. I recently bought a new bottle and think that I may have to keep it in my shower and buy my kids another one!,The Smell is AMAZING!

1,"This cream did not do much for my face or throat area. I have gone back to my generic brand, it works better and is not as expensive. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",Gave it a Try
1,"I used (and loved) this product for several years until they changed it. It used to moisturize my skin and left it feeling soft. Now, it sits on top of my skin and is never absorbed. It just leaves a slimy film on my skin. I will no longer purchase this product.",New formula is terrible
1,"I have been using Oil of Olay for over 20 years. This product worked so well for me, but the new formula is HORRIBLE! I cannot find anything to work for my skin like it did! The smell is flowery and it is too thick. The old formula was so light",PLEASE BRING BACK OLD FORMULA!!!
1,"I am so disappointed! I have used this product for years because of it's soft smell and great results. The new formula feels greasy, smells awful and I don't feel like my skin looks as toned and wrinkle free anymore. This was a five star product for so many years...why change it Please bring back the old formula.",Please bring back the old formula
1,"I've been using this product for years and it was terrific. This improved formula is terrible. It doesn't have the hydrating power it had -- it's much thinner and stickier. Heaven help you if you get some on your lips - it tastes terrible! PLEASE dump this improved formula. Until then, I'm shopping for a new moisturizer... alas",What happened!!
1,"It took me so long to find a moisturizer that worked well for me and I loved this product. However, this new formula has a smell that is too strong for me and feels very greasy once applied. Unfortunately I will no longer be purchasing this product and will have to search again for another moisturizer. Please Olay, bring back your old formula. It was so much better.",Please Bring Back Old Formula
1,"Used to swear by this product as my daily moisturizer. I loved it because it felt thick and creamy and did a great job without being greasy or feeling heavy. However, just bought the first container of the new formula. It's terrible! It leaves a greasy feel that does not go away and makes it impossible to apply makeup, even 10 minutes after. Your skin just feels slimy to the touch, slippery. And the scent is way stronger. Please, OLAY, give us our old formula back!! I'll be purchasing something else.",new formula is terrible
1,Olay don't work for me I have overly dry skin. I haven't found anything to work on my skin. So I'm hoping to be able to find something that will work. But I'm affrid I won't be able to find anything to help my skin not be so dry. It gets so bad the I dig at my legs all the time.,The product smells ok
1,I used it for several days in a row and I felt like I was wearing a mask. And my skin felt unnatural and dry under it. My skin felt coated instead of hydrated. I will not purchased this product again.,It didn't feel natural on my skin.
1,"I buy Olay Regenerist all the time from CVS and Rite Aid. This time around I purchased it from Wal Mart's online store, and when I received it, the formula was slightly different. The lotion smells like the cheaper products Olay makes. I am very disappointed and will not order from Walmart online again.",Different formula than normal
1,"my mother and i have vowed by this product for years and years... when i first started paying attention to skincare, she gave me a bottle of olay regenerist and it's all i've ever needed ... the only thing that works (and i have spent so much money exploring more high-end brands)! so you can understand why i'm upset that the formula was tampered with... this new and improved cream smells awful (the scent is way too strong), it appears that they've watered it down, it's mushy on my face and if i touch my face at any point during the day, it starts peeling off... it's greasy and does not work well under makeup at all! my mom and i are now forced to look for a whole new line of products when we've stayed with olay for our whole lives. sad, sad, sad. BRING BACK THE OLD FORMULA!",what happened
2,"While this product probably does leave faces feeling nourished, I would not recommend using it as a daily moisturizer under makeup. It left my face full of crumbles as soon as I brushed on my makeup. Would probably be better as a night cream.",Not a good base for makeup!
2,Just didn't have the moisture I am used too. Thought I would try this but will go back to Nutragena,Not for me
2,GreatGreatmefeels great smells great succulent took away dry skin silky smooth enriching,Nice
3,"Today is my first time using this product. Felt great going on immediately, felt moisturized without being too greasy.

3,"Although this product worked amazingly well, the fragrance gave me headaches and made my eyes water daily-Olay please make more fragrance-free products.",too scented for me
3,"While I do love this product, having used it for at least 10 years, I prefer the old formulation better. I feel the new one doesn't hydrate as well, and leaves a thin film on my skin. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",Like the old formulation better
3,I want to try this so that I can answer these questions. It sounds like a product that would help my skin on my face. I just don't want my face to start sagging. I have always liked olay products. This review was collected as part of a promotion.,I have never used this before
3,"This product really helped keep my skin moisturized in the winter months. I used it morning and night with good results. It's a little heavy for warmer weather though, with my skin type anyway. This review was collected as part of a promotion.",This product really kept my winter face happy.
3,The product smells amazing need to use more often on my skin.,Best product ever. I like to use on my skin.
3,"I love the cleansers but this cream is a little too thick for me...I have trouble going to bed with it on...a bit greasy and has a lot of fragrance.

One point though, this cream has lasted a very long time, though I don't use it every night becuase it's not my favorite.",Its ok

3,"I rated the Olay Micro-Sculpting fragrance free a one because it did not absorb and made foundation glob. It peeled as i rubbed. This formula is much better for day use. It absorbs quickly and is not greasy. I does hydrate well, haven't seen all my wrinkles dissappear yet. :)",better for day use
3,I did not like the way it felt on my skin. I felt like I had on some sort of a skin mask. It may be OK for some people. But not for me. The moisturizer does have a creamy texture to it.,Might be OK for some.
